## FAQ and TL;DR/Most important advices:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it.
- (Optional) **Read the patch note**. This is a link to the ALEC (Azur Lane English Community/Azur Knights) JP patch note: https://discord.com/channels/321283108122918924/362997422018002944/790860232594817034
- **__PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1ST 2 FLEETS__**. Use your **Strongest** ships AND cats, current equipped gears doesn't matter, you can change after and it will apply.  My personal ideal clear comp is one fleet is Richi JB Percy and a torp front line (Naganami Noshiro Jintsuu) and this will solve almost all your mob fights. And the other is triple CVs, tanky high gun damage CA. This will be with you until you unlock 4 fleets which is about an hour of story maps. Which leads me to my next point.
- **__DO STORY UNTIL YOU UNLOCK 4 FLEETS__**: This fleet change is mandatory if you want to exit the port. This is where your 1st free fleet change comes in. Changing fleets and cats cost a lot of AP, up to 100 AP each. The cost get reduced down to 0 over time but it takes roughly 24 hours for it. My personal recommendation is as before, while your fleet 3 and 4 should be mimicking fleet 2 in a sense that it has 2 out of 3 damage type (Shelling/Torp/Plane) to counter the bosses.
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** This is content that is permanent for the most part (the META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. But it will take a lot of time and consistent game time to grind. AP has a soft cap of 100, regen 1 point per 10 mins.
- **Do story, seriously I'm not joking, do it, a lot is gated behind story**. The story marker are the red exclamation mark on the map. Why I say this is because story regions rewards a lot of modules allowing you to fight on par and above par against higher level enemies. If you are not end-game or fucked up your fleet set up, don't stray from the path cause high AP entry maps are hard, like W12/W13 lethal level of hard and entering cost AP. Especially so since you do not have enough modules to compete with the enemy so you get extra debuffed. (+/-30% on every facets, offense, defense, healing). Moreover, story unlocks essential daily/weekly rewards such as missions and strongholds.
- **Restart a.k.a leaving and retrying battles liberally.** There's no morale or oil cost. There's actually no downsides to retrying fights. If you missed your torp preload on the BB spawn and it burns your flag to hell and back, just restart.
- "How do I get out of the map when I finished clearing?" Click outside of the map to go to the overworld view. If you haven't cleared the region, you'll need a fleet at the edge so if you can't exit, move a fleet to the edge. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region unless it's a port)
- "How to change fleet and cats?" You will need to go to Order -> Fleet Redeployment to change your fleet and cats. The precise condition is unknown (possibly safe/cleared region) but the button is always available in a port.
- "What to buy with Supply Coin and Item Tokens?" Don't know yet, they will be exchanged for some kind of voucher ticket every 1st of every month (except Jan 1st) anyways so use them liberally.
- "Wait, what season?" The META ship season. This season ends on March 18.
- "Why do some region drop no EXP, what gives?" Story region gives no exp whatsoever, all maps do not give affection as well. After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately so don't be alarmed when you run out of AP and the game keeps asking you to refill.
- "What do the bosses here mean, why are they keep warning me?" Warning just means you are hitting a boss fleet, it's a typical one but do take note of the buffs they get (+50% AA and -50% shelling damage taken means you will need torp to do effective damage to the boss for example). They are level appropiate tho so do be careful cause you don't have enough modules early on to compete with theirs and you will get massively debuffed.
- "Refills? Should I do that?" The oil:AP ratio is 10:1. You can refill up to 5 times a **WEEK**, the game has typo, go figure. It's 1000/1000/2000/2000/4000 oil in that order. You can also buy AP packs in port shop with Supply Coins.
- "What is Meta Lab?" It's detailed in the [META Lab section](Operation%20Siren%20Guide.md#ashes-coordinate-and-hiryuu-meta)
- "Why are 5 or 6 star level regions so hard?" Because your current module count is low, your module count will be compared to the enemy, every point difference is 1% in your or the enemy favor (Offense and Defense is 70%-130%, Tactics (healing) is 70-100%)
- "What are 4th and 5th stars in region, why are they all ???" Because they are hidden requirement and sometimes RNG to boot. [Here's a datamined spreadsheet of all starring requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XvXwQ1MUvIbRe44G0eAfo9rnMGm6BflHbjGcbwIcNrE/edit?usp=sharing)

## General Gameplay:
- There's 3 important things 1st: 
   - Fleet swapping is bottom left now cause you will eventually get access to up to 4 fleet simultanously. 
   - Order tab: on the radar on the right side of the screen. Change fleet, resting to heal up and remove fatigue, recon, submarine call-ins all cost AP. Change fleet cost up to 99 AP, slowly drain to 0 over 24 hrs. Rest cost a static 50 and has a cooldown of 24 hrs as well. Recon cost up to 9 AP drain to 0 over 10-15 mins. Submarine support cost up to 39 AP and reset to 0 over 30 mins.
   - Scanning mode: clunky toggle but crucial to locate hidden cache and scan loot tiles. More details will be given in the Tile section below.
- Sinking: any sunk ships will be revived with 10% of their hp and given the "damaged" debuff (red wrench icon on the hp bar). This disables **ALL** skills and can only be removed by using the Regroup and Rest and Fleet Redeployment in the "Navigational Order" tab or repairing your ships at a port. __Healing a ship to full with repairkits will not remove the debuff.__
- Losing in combat: Most major boss fights (Abyss and Stronghold) are multi-staged, meaning the damage you dealt will remains. When a fleet lose in combat (via timing out or flag ship sinking or all vanguard dies), it is given the "Low Resolve X" debuff (can stack up to 3 times) indicated by a triangle (the more broken it is the stronger the debuff effect. Low resolve lowers FP, TRP, ASW, AVI, AA and EVA by 10% per stack. Low Resolve can be removed by winning battles (if done by other fleet it still counts) or using the Regroup and Rest and Fleet Deploy Navigational Orders. (Crucial for Abyss fights if your fleet is struggling)
- Change fleet and cats by going to Order (on the Radar to the right) then Fleet Redeployment.
- Don't be afraid of retreating or restarting, you don't have morale or oil cost to worry about, restart as much as you want to get the outcome that you want. Also **AVOID** ship sinking in Abyssal Zone cause you cannot recover from the "Damaged" debuff without using Rest and Regroup lest you want to give up on the boss.

## Overworld Map

- Ports: currently 4 ports are important (they are all blue colored: NYC, Liverpool, Gibraltar, St. Pete), they have their own shop that refresh every 3 days and have daily missions **after you finished story**. There's 2 kind of currency: Operation Supply Coins and Special Item Tokens. Using the supply coins liberally is fine, they are too abundant. The token can cost a lot (depending on your shop refresh and grind) and there's not much way to replenish them so I'd say be a bit more cautious on what you buy with them (Gold and Rainbow Plates and Designs are good purchases, Coordinate purchase depends on your fleet power, if you can't kill a 128 abyss boss consistently, don't bother). Akashi random event and Port shops sell these tokens for coins so always buy them if possible. More detailed Shop purchase guide below.
- Regions that cost AP to enter (story regions has red exclamation mark on it cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan if they allow you). After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately.
- Explanations of on screen markers:
   - Red exclamation marks: Main story markers, follow this until you finish the story. Finishing story (4-6) will unlock daily missions and weekly strongholds
   - Green clipboards = Puzzle Portals and Daily Quest markers (any side missions that show up in the Information tab will be marked as such)
   - Yellow chests = Fracture Sea/Obscured Zone from blue coordinates in storage (alternate zone that will have you clear some rally points for loot, using the teleporter will move you back to the region b4 you enter)
   - Gold coin icon = just rewards markers for AP chest/healing boxes/coins (mostly shown as rewards for regions you haven't controlled)
   - Blue Hexagon icon = respective Adaptive stat boost, click on it to see details on which stat if you aren't familiar with adaptive stat icon(shown as rewards for regions you haven't controlled)
   - Red boss icon = One time entry Abyssal Zones from Red coordinates (depending on Corrosion level boss with a massive hp pool and requires multiple fleets to tackle). If you leave after unlocking the gate to spawn the boss, the boss will disappear. Can drops high quality loot (up to rainbow mats) from Corrosion level 4 and above. They don't hit as hard as Stronghold bosses however. There's 2 mob fleet on the bottom right of the screen shrouded in fog, to get there and get a win to cleaar your t
   - Swirling Abyss = Strongholds (level 128 enemies with 144/144/144 stat) cost 100 AP ONCE to enter and can be retreated freely for repairs. Only spawn after finishing story. Can drops high quality loot (rainbow mats).

## Regional Map

- Think of it as normal maps in every chapter in main campaign (and AP as the 10 oil cost to enter). Harder region cost more AP (80 AP region has level 114 mobs and 118 boss, 60 AP has level 103-104, 108 boss, Abyss cost up to 100 AP and spawn 128 boss)
- Every fleet has their movement restricted in turns (much like event maps where you have limited movement tiles). Same concept here but turns actually have an effect on the map. The map is semi-dynamic in that mobs might spawn in over time, cat salvages overtime, discovering elite fleets (enhanced enemies with modules and more drops) when you meet them on the map
- Recon reveal the entire map so scanning mode will reveal hidden cache easier.
- Retreating from a region requires a fleet at the edge of the map if you haven't cleared it. If you have, just click outside.
- The hardest currently available regions are: Strongholds and High Corrosion Abyss Coordinates.
- Strongholds reset once a week (likely monday) to a cap of 3, they have level 128 bosses and mobs which can be hard if under adaptive stats.
- Abyssal zones spawn when using Coordinates in Storage. Can have multi-stage bosses (ranging from 108 to 128) who will show a weakness after a certain hp threshold.
- Reinforcements (colored blue rather than red) drops no exp or loot.

#### Adaptability Stat:
Offense, Survivability, Tactic Adaptability all either buff or debuff the enemy depends on the enemy's count and your own. You can increase it with Tuning items (they are perma until reset so just use them as you get them) or Adaptability modules collected in the map. The difference will make up the modifier with Offense affect the enemy's damage dealt, Survivability affect their hp and Tactics affect YOUR fleet healing capability. With Offense and Survivability ranging from 70%-130% and Tactics (healing) is 70-100% so you can have your Tactics stat below the other 2 by a margin of 30-40 points. Early abyssal zones only have 60 and then 90, it increases the more zones you do up to the level 128 boss with 144 stat so to max out you need ~180 of Offense and Survival with Tactic at 140-150.

#### Main OpSiren Story
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP after that. They also do not give EXP except the boss fight iirc.

#### Map stars
- Each map has 5 stars you can get. Star 4 and 5 are for now "???" meaning locked and can't be obtained so just ignore it.
Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area. [Intel] can spawn [randomly(?)] revealing an additional star requirement.
- Star rewards can be claimed at ports. (there are 75 regions so dw about rushing this content)
- Some starring requirement are RNG
- [Here's a datamined spreadsheet of all starring requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XvXwQ1MUvIbRe44G0eAfo9rnMGm6BflHbjGcbwIcNrE/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Anomaly weather zone:
RNG Starring condition, there's a loot marker in it coupled with some weather tiles (currents, windstorms, etc) that rewards adaptive stat.

#### Siren floating rewards
Seems to spawn 5 interest points, you can only collect up to 3, 2 will always sink regardless of turns taken. Sometimes can spawn an ambush fleet that drops next to nothing or a Siren warning that sinks all other points.

#### Siren Jamming 
Box that spawn after defeating a boss. Collecting it will jam your fleet, reducing that fleet movement to 1 tile for the next 5 moves. In Fractured Sea, there exist a variation that will spawn a bunch of weather tiles on loot.

#### Meowficers Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for an amount (about 10) of turns, then they will return with rewards. Rewards are based on Meowficcer levels and rarity.

#### Energy matrix:
Collect the Matrix on the map and deliver it to the platform to get rewards. There's a variation of this in Fractured Sea that has 4 Matrixes, move close to it will spawn 4 hidden matrix on the map which can be revealed with scanning mode.

#### Energy Cache: (Place where you use the Energy Storage Device or ESD)
Go there, use the Energy Storage Device and you get loot, if it fails, just smash it. Spending the ESD will rewards with adaptive stat. Smashing seems to never give adaptive stat.

#### Siren Coordinate Logger
Looks like a oil rig, moving on it and you will be ambushed twice and gain access to the device (up to 3-4 times). You can either spend one Energy Storage to spawn a mob fleet (that doesn't drop modules) or 2 item tokens to spawn an Energy Cache event (that rewards modules and some other loot) or just a "Sparkle" loot which doesn't disappear but doesn't drop anything lucrative either.

#### Blockade
Square-shaped formation that locks your fleet in when you step in to them as well as spawn 3 moduled buffed mob fleet. Defeating all the moduled fleet lift the blockade. In fractured sea, there's also a variation where it will spawn 3 blockades looking tile and one outside of the 5x5 tiles. Moving a fleet to the one spawn outside will destroy the hologram in the zone.

#### Light house:
Light house zone seems to always spawn on massive Fractured sea on the South most square (30x30 map, divided into 9 5x5 square shaped zone with its own RNG spawn and 3 Siren Rally points). Using a ESD will perform a free recon. If one has already used the recon using AP, ignore this zone.

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which might force you into a fight with a siren defense fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point. Reinforcement fleets (blue in color) spawn in infinitely and they don't drop any loot, avoid them if possible. Clearing all Rally points spawn a Teleporter and some chests in Fractured Sea.

#### Siren Data Center(?)
A plus formation of sort, with obstacle constructs that spawn in Fractured Sea that spawn with a couple EMP tiles. After stepping on all of the (usually 3) weather anomalies, it will spawn 2 hidden Meowfficer search nodes which can be revealed with scanning mode.

#### EMP tiles:
Cause random movement of your fleet for 1-2 turns when stepped on.

#### Ice pillars and ice floes:
Ice pillars block movement entirely and sometimes can be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower. Ice floes looks like ice tiles that will continue your fleet momentum till it's next to an obstacle or another fleet.

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile. Sometimes there's a Fog control tower that you can go to and remove all fog on the map.

#### Maelstrom
Hazier and redder in color than Fog and also seems to block movement through it entirely, can only be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower.

#### Whirlpool
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned, eating your moevement, meaning that reinforcements can spawn and move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Directional Wind Storms:
Will launch your fleet a set number of tiles over all obstacles when stepped on.

#### Ocean Currents:
Direct your fleet to the tile it points to.

#### Flaming Sea:
Do a %hp damage to all unit in the fleet and persist a turn.

#### Colored blockers:
Only in Puzzle maps, using the corresponding control tower will turn pebbles into movement blocking contructs and vice versa. 

## Enemies

#### Sirens
Sirens move whenever you move three times, and unlike events they move 5 tiles at once instead of 2, so plan ahead if you want to avoid them with your fleets. You can also just retreat when they caught up, not much reason to fight them if they are just blue reinforcement that drop no loot.

#### Dangerous enemies (Mixed Recon/Main/Aviation Fleets)
Basically boss fleets. Have specialized modules that buff/debuff stats/defense making them harder or easier to kill with/without the proper damage type. The list of possible module buffs are [here](

#### Stronghold Bosses and Abyssal Bosses
Big bad highly leveled Siren boss that has powerful accompanying modules that can seriously wreck fleets. They are also multi-staged boss fight so having multiple leveled fleets is nearly mandatory to beating them. Abyssal bosses reveal their weakness after a certain point.

## Ashes Showdown

#### TL;DR:
- Only unlocks after clearing chapter 1 of the OpSi story
- Do maps, kill bosses, collect chests/loot spawns and you will get some coordinate points.
- Get 100 coordinate points and you can host/summon your META boss up to twice a day.
- Host don't need to do anything but send out invites, supporters will kill it for you. Host gets 135 + 15 per level Analysis points (150 for level 1, 165 or level 2, etc). Supporters gets 27 + 3 per level Analysis Points (30 for level 1, 33 for level 2, etc). **Except for level 15 which you gets 71 points**. You get 2 host per day and 3 support per day. Host counter is above your Analysis point count, if it's greyed out, you will stop accumulating coordinate points (you will start at 0 the next day). Support counter is on the top right of the Ashes Showdown interface.
- The fight last 60s, the boss kinda does damage and it cost no oil, AP, morale to do and gives no exp or affection either.
- The strat is: if you host then go in, change your fleet to your best boss slayer fleet (the fight last 60s), save your fleet, get out and invite people, ignore it and do your 3 support attempts while waiting. To use your support entries: sit in chat room, wait till someone post an invite and click to join in OR choose one on boss list and click attack till you get a fight (If the game pops up an expired, it means the boss already dies). Have fun~~~

#### Patch Note that explains this in a long-winded way:
You can obtain Analysis Points by defeating the META boss in Ashes Showdown.
Achieve Analysis Point milestones to obtain META ships and other rewards.

Ashes Showdown involves the following 2 elements,
1) Ashes Coordinate Analysis (unlocking the boss fight)
2) Fighting the META boss

※ Ashes Showdown is unlocked after clearing chapter 1 of the Operation Siren story campaign.

★ Ashes Coordinate Analysis
You can obtain Ashes Coordinates from a number of ways including defeating enemies.
The number of Ashes Coordinates is displayed on the upper right corner of the sea region map.

Once you have obtained the max number of Ashes Coordinates, you can unlock the META boss fight by performing Coordinate Analysis using all of your Coordinates.
You can only perform Coordinate Analysis twice per day.
After daily reset, you will be able to perform Coordinate Analysis again, but the number of your Ashes Coordinates will be reset back to the starting number.

★ Fighting the META boss
You can access the fight from the button on the lower right corner of the sea region map.
The META boss fight involves,
1) The fight that you yourself unlock
2) Any requests for backup that you accept from other commanders.

Fleets sortied for Operation Siren can be used for the boss fight. Meowfficers and submarines cannot be used.
Once you complete a META boss fight that you unlocked yourself, the next META boss will be harder (a level increase).
Requesting for backup allows other commanders to access your META boss fight.

Defeating the boss rewards Analysis Points. If it was a coop fight, all commanders who participated will receive Analysis Points.

※ A META boss fight will be open for 24 hours.
※ You may spend Fuel and attempt the META boss fight which you unlocked yourself as many times as you would like until the boss is defeated.
※ There is a limit on how many backup requests you can accept per day.
※ A maximum of 30 commanders can participate in 1 Ashes Showdown. The boss fight will become unable to join once full.
※ Ashes Showdown does not give any ship EXP nor does it affect ship morale and affection.
